I am a PhD student at the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), specializing in the research of large language models (LLMs). I am expected to graduate in July 2025.

My research focuses on model compression and acceleration, specifically in the context of LLMs. I am interested in utilizing techniques like quantization, knowledge distillation, and pruning to improve computational efficiency and performance of LLMs. My ultimate goal is to achieve efficient language models.
