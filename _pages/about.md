I am a PhD student at the [Institute of Information Engineering](http://www.iie.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)](https://www.cas.cn/), specializing in the research of large language models (LLMs). I am expected to graduate in July 2025.

My research focuses on model compression and acceleration, specifically in the context of LLMs. I am interested in utilizing techniques like quantization, knowledge distillation, and pruning to improve computational efficiency and performance of LLMs. My ultimate goal is to achieve efficient language models.
