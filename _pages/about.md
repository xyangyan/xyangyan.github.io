I am a PhD student at the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), specializing in the research of large language models (LLMs). I am expected to graduate in July 2025.

My research focuses on model compression and acceleration, particularly in the context of LLMs. Specifically, I am interested in delving into the fundamental theories of large language models and leveraging techniques such as quantization, knowledge distillation, and pruning to improve computational efficiency and performance, ultimately aiming to achieve efficient language models.
